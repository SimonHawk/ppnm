PragProg U4F2 noter:

Today: GNU plot
	We use it because it is widely used, and produces publication quality
	figures.
	It also can be well integrated with Latex to make fonts and sizes nice.

Using GNU Plot:
	Can be used in interaction mode, but we won't use that.
	echo 'plot sin(x)' | gnuplot --persist
	Plots sin(x)
	gnuplot -p -e 'plot sin(x)' does the same
	But we will take these commands from a GNU script file.
	Extension can be: .gpi (gnu plot instructions)

Gamma function approximations:
	The gamma function is not so nice to approximate.
	Dimitri has made it nicer for us by defining a reflection to use in the
	negative argument case, and 

Files in exercises:
	Results should be in capital start letter. 
	Plots should be in svg for the exercies, but pdf when included in latex

GNU script commands:
	set term svg 		Set the terminal (output) to svg
	set out "Gamma.svg"		Sets the filename of the output
	plot [][-5:5] "out.gamma.txt" with lines
		Plot everything in x and -5 to 5 in y
		plot the data found in out.gamma.txt
		use lines
	We see a lot more very quickly, this can be seen in the gamma.gpi file

Gamma residues:
	We shift the argument of small gamma functions to make it more precise
	The less shifts we do the faster it will be.
