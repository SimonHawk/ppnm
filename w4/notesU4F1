PragProg U4F1 Notes

(In W3 Dimitry was sick and we didn't have any lectures)

Introdution:
	Today: Input output, writing and reading numbers.
	We will format it on table form for now in text representation, because
	 that is easy to work with.
	However, if you have huge files raw byte data is smaller, but we will
	not work with this.

Standard streams in unix:
	Nearly all programs in unix work on:
	Std input, std output and std error.
	Input steam is simply a sequence of bytes, which is taken from the
	keyboard input by default.

How to give input to programs:
	Command line:
		Just arguments given in the console when you run the program
		Very easy to work with, but not useful for long inputs.
		Used by defining a Main(string[] args)
		
ECHO
	Unix command that thakes it command line arguments and puts them in 
	the standard output.

$(RM) macro:
	Is just "rm --force" by default.
	But if you want to do something else, you can just overwrite it, and
	that might be usefull for bigger projects.
		
foreach loop:
	If object is countable, it must provide a way to use for each on the
	form: foreach(var s in args) where args is some coutable object.
	
Unix "files"
	All devices in unix, like the network card looks like files to the 
	system. Wow. You can communicate with devices by sending streams
	of bytes into what looks like "files" to the system.

"break"
	Breaks the current loop and goes out of it. Maybe general to blocks?
