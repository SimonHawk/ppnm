Problem A
Completed training the sin function for 5, 11 and 17 nodes:
Sampled sine points:         20
Minimization accuracy goal:  1E-06
Minimization steps:          1001
(OBS: Accuracy goal was not reached as maximum number of steps was reached)

Looking at figure A.interpolation.svg it seems that while the 11 node interpolation hits the points better than the 5 node one, it is more susceptible to wiggle. However, the 17 node interpolation does not exhibit this wiggle.
