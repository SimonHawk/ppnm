Problem B:
Training the neutral network to interpolate the Sine function:
Sampled sine points:         20
Network nodes:               11
Minimization accuracy goal:  1E-06
Minimization steps:          1001
(OBS: Accuracy goal was not reached as maximum number of steps was reached)

See figure B.interpolation.svg for the result.
