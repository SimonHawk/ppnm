Testing the convergence of the eigenvalues and vectors.

Using the Lanczos algorithm on the same 50x50 random symmetric matrix,
to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors for m = 1 to 50 iterations.

These are compared to the ones found for m = n = 50, which were
previously shown to be the true values.

For the eigenvectors, the sign is arbitrary, which was taken into account.

It appears for m going to n, both the lowest and highest eigenvalues and
 eigenvectors go towards the correct ones.
However, in all cases, the best convergence seems to be for the single
highest eigenvalue.
