--- INTRO: ---
In this folder, you will find my solution to the PPNM exam project.

My student number is 201609122.
There are 22 project, and thereby, my assigned project is:
mod(22, 22) = 0

Number 0: Lanczos tridiagonalization algorithm.


--- STRUCTURE: ---
In this folder (/exam/) you will find code output txt files that 
demonstrate that my solution works as intended:

	out.demo.txt:   Shows that my implemented Lanczos algorithm produces
				    the intended V and T matricies for a random symmetric
				    matrix.

	out.eigen.txt:  Demonstrates how the Lanczos algorithm can be used to
					find correct eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a random 
					symmetric matrix.

The implementation of the numerical method can be found in the /exam/lib/ 
folder.

The demonstration code that outputs the demonstration files can be found in 
the /exam/demo/ folder.



--- FORMATTING ---
I have written the code to fit in a terminal that is 80 characters wide.
