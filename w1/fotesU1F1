PragProg U1F1

Intro: 	Dimitri recommends making groups of 2-3

Examn:	Is a project. Deadline is in the end of june, idependent of the actual examn date.

What language should we use?
	Dimitri thinks C is a bit boring now. C++ is too complicated. Java has bad restrictions. 
	Python we know already. C-sharp is a good comprimize between C and C++.
	
	C sharp is compiled to bytecode and runs on a virtual machine. This is actually not
	that much slower than purely compiled code. Also, it can potentilly be more smart about
	methods to use for calculations, but this is not implemented yet. It is a bit slower than
	C but not much. 

	C sharp has an automatic garbage collector, C does not. Uses much more memory though, at
	least twize as much.	
	
	We are going to use C-sharp in the course
	
How to install systems?
	Many ways to do it. We talk about these things.

Note: 	At some point we should be able to answer all the questions on the weekly notice for a
	test.

Using C-sharp
	We install "mono-mcs". This is different from .net i think? Didn't get this.
	Dimitri shows us how to compile some stuff on grendel.
	C-sharp files have the extension .cs
	mono is the vertual machine
	After compiation we have an .exe file that needs to be run with mono.
	
Later:	
	We will program hello world
	We will learn to use git for version control, (but not now)	

Programming hello world:
	Everything in cs must be in a class.
	There must be a main function that the system can call, and then this main can call other
	function
	In cs main must be static.
	We compile with mcs and run the resulting exe with mono.
	We will only make console applications, because these are the types of programs you run
	on supercomputers.
