# ppnm
Repository for my work in the course "Practical Programming and Numerical Methods".

# This is private
Because I think it has to be later anyway, for when we hand in the exercises for the exam.

# Organization
The material is organized according to the week they correspond to. In each week, the answers to the different exercises are found, as well as extra files and notes I have made myself.
