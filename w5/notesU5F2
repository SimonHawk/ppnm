Today:

Our wiki:
	We have to add outselves to wikipedia.
	Add image 128x128 half scale? Has to be jpg
	Password for upload is "jpeg"
	Later we add our own grades to this wikipedia

Integration:
	Rutines can somethimes handle singularities in the integration region
	but it is unsafe. Better split it up and have singularities at
	end points.
	Kinks are also bad for integration, better to split interval on kinks

ODE:
	Rewrite this equation
	u'' = -u
	
	Using:
	y0 = u
	y1 = u'
	
	Then 
	y0' = y1
	y1' = -y0
	
	This can be integrated using the 

ODE Solvers:
	We go through the arguments to the rk23 arguments

	ODE solvers have drivers and steppers
	Drivers control how the solution is made and sampled and so on
	Stepper just makes step based on where it is.
