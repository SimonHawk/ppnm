Today:
	Functional programming i CSharp
	Needed for integration rutine.	

Introduction:
	I C sharp, function passing is made safe through "delegates", which
	is kind of like a pointer of to a function

Delagates:
	Delagates needs to be declared:
	delegate double myfun(double x) is ready to contain a pointer to a
	function
	Delegates can only be declared in some class?
	Each delegate is a different type, even if they have the same signature
	However, there is a generic delegate in the system class.
	Func<double, double>	takes a double(1st) and returns a double (2nd)
	
First class functions:
	If funcitons are treated like normal variables, they are called first
	class functions.
	C sharp also has first class functions.

Closures:
	How is variables in functions captured?
	In c sharp environment for each function is automatically made and saved
	Captures by value, not by reference.Each makefun call will have its
	own a.
	The closure is only made on return.
	Variables are captured on return?

PAssing functions as parameters
	Just use Func<> as parameter type.

Using integrator:
	quad.o8av(f, a, b)
	f is a Func<double, double> function
	a and b are the limits.
	
	Numerical integrators can always be cheated, so you need to do checks
	yourself.

	we are using: 
		o: open point, can handle singularities at the end points
		8: function needs to be 8 times differentiable. 
		a: adaptive
		v: with variable substitution
